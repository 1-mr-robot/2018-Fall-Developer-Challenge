# Challenge 1: Send Me Some (Worthless) Ether

## Introduction

This is a simple task, all you need to do is to send us some (fake) ether to a designated account, and hopefully through the process you get a rough idea of some concepts of transactions on Ethereum blockchain.

## Hints

Here're some recommended tools you might need:

1. [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) is a broswer extension working as your cryptocurrency wallet. ( [more](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-for-beginners/ethereum-wallets#desktop-wallets) about all kinds of wallet) You'll need to find out by yourself how to install MetaMask and how to use it.

2. [EtherScan](https://etherscan.io/) is a [block explorer](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/block-explorer.asp) for Ethereum Blockchain. There are many [testnets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Testnet) each of which has its own history. For example, `Kovan Testnet` could be accessed at https://kovan.etherscan.io. Testnet are sandbox for product testing before rolling out that replicate the exact main net client implementation, meaning all nodes on testnet are running the same protocol as their Ethereum mainnet (i.e. real one) counterpart. 

3. [Kovan Testnet Faucet](https://github.com/kovan-testnet/faucet) is where you could receive some Ether on `Kovan Testnet` (just a name) for free that's has no real-life value, and it's only distributed to those who want to test out in the testnet sandbox.

## Challenge

Send **0.5 ether** to account address: `0xcc6b9a2ef844002c413d992b980eeb7b08899a10` and **copy the transaction hash** down for submission. 

NOTE 1: Please do notice the actual fee being paid( is it exactly 0.5 ether, why? ). 

NOTE 2: You need to figure out where to get your transactionHash from MetaMask yourself.

## Submission

Please specify your `transactionHash` to an email (together with other challenges solution, if any) and send to [blockchain.ntusg@gmail.com](mailto:blockchain.ntusg@gmail.com). Please also fill in the email topic with "2018 Recruitment Challenge -- Blockchain@NTU".
